"""
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two
given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v
and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another
example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of
itself according to the LCA definition.
